# LayerZero ONFT721 Example

## 1) Developing Contracts

#### Installing dependencies

We recommend using `pnpm` as a package manager (but you can of course use a package manager of your choice):

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Compiling your contracts

This project supports both `hardhat` and `forge` compilation. By default, the `compile` command will execute both:

```bash
pnpm compile
```

If you prefer one over the other, you can use the tooling-specific commands:

```bash
pnpm compile:forge
pnpm compile:hardhat
```

#### Running tests

Similarly to the contract compilation, we support both `hardhat` and `forge` tests. By default, the `test` command will execute both:

```bash
pnpm test
```

If you prefer one over the other, you can use the tooling-specific commands:

```bash
pnpm test:forge
pnpm test:hardhat
pnpm test:hardhat test/layer-zero-already-contract.ts
pnpm test:hardhat test/layer-zero.ts
```

## 2) Deploying Contracts

- Rename `.env.example` -> `.env`
- Choose your preferred means of setting up your deployer wallet/account:

```
MNEMONIC="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
or...
PRIVATE_KEY="0xabc...def"
```

```bash
npx hardhat lz:deploy
```

## 3) Check Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat lz:oapp:config:get --oapp-config layerzero.config.ts
```
